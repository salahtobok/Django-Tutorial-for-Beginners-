migrations : what migrations are are basically a way that you can hook up or connect your website all of your source code with your database
admin : so whenever they're creating Django they realize that almost every website in the world it has an admin section a section that you can go and like access that base and delete users and delete posts whatever you want to do so instead of having to make it yourself it already has that admin functionality so that's what this is and there's a lot more to it but that's basically what it is
apps this file is just again there's a lot more to it but it's pretty much the configuration file or settings for this app and right now we don't have a lot of settings it says the name of it is music ah all right there we go so thank you Django for letting me know that alright so 
models : the next one is models so a model is basically a blueprint for your database so it's a template of how you are going to store data for this app so real quick let's go ahead and think about how we are going to do that what do we want to store what tables are we going to want in the music app well we're probably going to want one for like albums and each album is going to need like a title and maybe the artist and we're probably going to want another table to store maybe the individual songs so you know each song of course is going to have a title a length so on and so forth so later on we'll create two classes in here one class is just going to be albums in another class is going to be songs so that's basically the blueprint of how we're going to set up our database it's going to be fun 
test : this one right here this test probably don't even need to explain this you can create a bunch of little tests to make sure that you don't have any bugs in your code 
views : this views views are actually really easy views are just functions they're just Python functions and what they do is they take a user request and they give them back something now 95% of the time these are just going to request the webpage and you just give them a web page like you're looking at someone's profile they send you that HTML page you look at a video page they send you all those files whatever now other times it isn't that direct like maybe these are just wants to log out or download something so you would perform some action but basically views are just Python functions that take a request from the user and respond or get back a response in some kind of way
